// 👋 Hey Creator
// Config starts at the line with "export default" and continues below.
// All of the stuff that starts with / or /* like thing are just comments.

// 👀 How It Works
// This file exports a JavaScript object of settings/config for the generator to use.

// 🎓 JavaScript Objects 101
// Feel free to skip class if you already know what you're doing.

// 1. Everything inside the export default {} is your config. {} means object.
//    Then we add stuff to that object.So don't change  or remove the top
//    level wrapper, only the properties inside it.
// 2. Inside the main {}, things to the left of a : are setting names.
// 3. Things to the right of the : is the value to that setting.
// 4. If a value looks like this {} it's a group of settings. Maybe some subsettings.
//    It's just a nested object, like the top level one you're already adding properties to.
// 5. If a value looks like this [] it's called an array which is a list of anything.
//    It can be a list of single values or a list of objects (a group of a few values).
//    The only array in this project is the attributes array which contains a list
//    of attribute objects and their individual settings.

// You graduated 🤝📄
